## Algorithms

This is a collection of online submissions I've done as part of my software engineering training. Feel free to use them as base or reference, some of them are pretty interesting, and I usually document my approach so I can come back in the future and improve it, or if someone is stuck with this same problems.

Happy coding! <3
