# Algorithms

## Description

It's a collection of algorithms I plan to be practicing on durign the next few months to improve my programming skills. Might be far from great, but it's first steps for learning.

For Testing: 

Simply switch into any of the modules, and do

```bash
ginkgo
```

Right now it's reporting:

```bash
Running Suite: Reverser algorithm
=================================
Random Seed: 1624040855
Will run 7 of 7 specs

•••••••
Ran 7 of 7 Specs in 0.000 seconds
SUCCESS! -- 7 Passed | 0 Failed | 0 Pending | 0 Skipped
PASS

Ginkgo ran 1 suite in 1.35913528s
Test Suite Passed
```

Feel free to add any extra test scenarios that you think are necessary.
