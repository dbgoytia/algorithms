Problem statement
---------------

Implement an algorithm that is capable of recognizing palindrome numbers:

Example 1: 121 is a palindrome number, since 121 reversed is 121 as well.
 
Example 2: -121 is not a palindrome number, since -121 reversed is 121-.

Example 3:  123 is not a palindrome number, since 123 reversed is 321.
