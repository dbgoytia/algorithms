## Day 16

Today's assignment is to build a coffee machine <3, same as the other day, but using OOP.
The aim of the exercise is to understand how using Python Modules and OOP you cut the time
of developing various functionallity a lot. Basically the aim is to trust that the developer
of the module has already done the heavy lifting for us. You'll notice that this is also a much
cleaner solution than the one provided on day 15.

The program requirements are described under "Coffee machine program requirements."
