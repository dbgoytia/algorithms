## Snake game

This is the second part for the snake game. The snake game is really simple. The rules of the game are to fetch as much food as you can, and avoid hitting the walls or your own tail. Try to do as much score as you can. 

## Controllers
For the controls, use the arrows to move the snake. 

The game ends when you crash into a wall, or when you crash with your own tail.

## Why did I come back to an old exercise?

I wanted to come back to this implementation to improve it and to learn how to keep score of the game.

## Features

* Scoreboard
* Optimized Snake movement
* Keep scoreboard of your games
