# The US State Game

The idea is to write as many names of the US states as you can remember.
You only need to type in the state, and if the state exists, you'll see
it appear on the screen.


# Implementation

We're going to continue to use Python.Turtle to build this project. The
background is simply a US map, and all the data is pulled from CSV using
Pandas.

One funny thing I found is that Python.Turtle only works with gif images,
so in order to display the map I had to use this format.
