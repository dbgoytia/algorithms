# Central Park Squirrel Census

Back in 2018, some volunteers went into NY Central Park to get some metadata
around **squirrels**. Fun! I know. We will be using the data that this volunteers
gathered, and get some data analysis fun with it.

# Goals:

1. Find how many colours of squirrel are there (gray, cinammon, black)? Output
this into squirrel_count.csv using a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Find distribution of squirrels by age

3. Find the squirrels activity

4. Find the squirrels activity per shift
