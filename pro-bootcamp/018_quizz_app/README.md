## Quiz App

The challenge here was to model a question application using OOP!
Very interesting challenge, in case you want to give it a go, here are the instructions (below)! I really encourage you to give it a go.

In any case, feel free to take a look at *my_solution* to see what I've done!

## Instructions 

* Develop a question model under the *question_model.py*
* Develop a quiz brain under the *quiz_brain.py*
    * The quizbrain will provide the following functionallity
        * The quizbrain class initializes with the current question number, and a question_bank (provided as an example in *data.py*)
        * It should prompt next_question for users.
        * It should be able to check the answer
* The main loop should bring up the input from the user (in *main.py*) and it the end, report the score to the user.
